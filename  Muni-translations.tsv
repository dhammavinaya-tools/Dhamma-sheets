25	3.6 Sabhiya	Chetvā āsavāni ālayāni, Vidvā so na upeti gabbhaseyyaṁ; Saññaṁ tividhaṁ panujja paṅkaṁ, Kappaṁ neti tamāhu ariyoti.	Having cut off defilements and attachments, being wise, they enter no womb. They’ve expelled the bog of the three perceptions, the one they call ‘noble’ does not return to creation.						535	
26	3.6 Sabhiya	Yo idha caraṇesu pattipatto, Kusalo sabbadā ājānāti dhammaṁ; Sabbattha na sajjati vimuttacitto, Paṭighā yassa na santi caraṇavā so.	One here who is accomplished and skillful in all forms of good conduct; always understanding the teaching, everywhere not stuck, freed in mind, who has no repulsion: they are ‘well-conducted’.						536	
27	3.6 Sabhiya	Dukkhavepakkaṁ yadatthi kammaṁ, Uddhamadho tiriyaṁ vāpi majjhe; Paribbājayitvā pariññacārī, Māyaṁ mānamathopi lobhakodhaṁ; Pariyantamakāsi nāmarūpaṁ, Taṁ paribbājakamāhu pattipattan"ti.	They wander full of wisdom, having banished any deed that results in suffering, deceit and conceit, as well as greed and anger, above, below, all round, between. They have made a limit on name & form; the one they call a ‘wanderer’ has reached their destination.”						537
