## Parallels Master

A master spreadsheet of **all parallels from SuttaCentral**, reorganized so they’re easier to work with **by collection** (SN, AN, SA, EA, Vinaya, etc.).

Each **row** = one base text (e.g. `SN1.20`, `ITI63`, `SAG`).  
Each **column** captures a different type of parallel:

- **Collection** – Where the base text lives (SN, AN, SAG, ITI, etc.).
- **SuttaCode** – SuttaCentral-style code for the base text.
- **PTS** – PTS page/volume reference (when available).
- **Parallels (Nikayas)** – Pali Nikāya parallels (DN, MN, SN, AN, KN).
- **Āgamas / Taishō** – Chinese Āgama parallels (T-numbers, Taishō edition).
- **Sanskrit** – Known Sanskrit or fragment parallels.
- **Vinaya** – Vinaya parallels in the different Vinaya collections.
- **Others** – Additional related texts (commentaries, later sources, etc.).
- **Partial Parallels (Nikaya, Āgamas w/ segments)** – Parallels matching **only part** of the base text, with segment IDs.
- **All without segments** – All parallels in one compact list, **no segments**.
- **All with segments (ALL)** – Same again, **with segment markers** for precise mapping.
