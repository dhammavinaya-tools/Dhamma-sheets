9.4	MĀGANDIYA	To Magandiya	vinicchayā yāni pakappitāni (iti māgandiyo ) te ve munī brūsi anuggahāya ajjhattasantīti yametamatthaṃ kathaṃ nu dhīrehi paveditaṃ taṃ	The evaluations that have been made, of not assuming them, Muni, you are talking. The “inner peace”—what this term means— how is it being made known by the wise?	“O sage, you speak of judgments you have formed,” said Māgaṇḍiya, “without having adopted any of those views. As to that matter of ‘inner peace’— how is that described by the wise?”	Māgandiya: “Sage, you speak of not grasping at any theorized judgments. This ‘inner peace’: What does it mean? How is it, by the enlightened, proclaimed?”	“Indeed, muni, you speak without grasping those judgments that have been formulated,” (said Māgandiya). “As to that matter called ‘the peace within,’ how is it proclaimed by the wise?”	Among what’s constructed thoroughly knowing, Ungrasping, O Sage, do you speak upon these, “inward peacefulness”—what meaning has that, how will the wise declare it to be?			838	 It will also be noticed that the Chinese translation has no verses corresponding to Sn. 886-888, but substitutes tor these three, only two verses, which are al-together difierent. 	
9.5	MĀGANDIYA	To Magandiya	na diṭṭhiyā na sutiyā na ñāṇena (māgandiyāti bhagavā) sīlabbatenāpi na suddhimāha adiṭṭhiyā assutiyā añāṇā asīlatā abbatā nopi tena ete ca nissajja anuggahāya santo anissāya bhavaṃ na jappe	Not through view, learning or knowledge, nor through virtue and practice do I declare purity. Even so, not without view, learning and knowledge and also not without virtue, without practice. Relinquishing these without taking up, peaceful without depending, one should not yearn for existence	“Purity is neither spoken of in terms of view,” said the Buddha to Māgaṇḍiya, “oral transmission, notion, and precepts and vows; nor in terms of that without view, oral transmission, notion, and precepts and vows. Having relinquished these, not adopting them, peaceful, independent, one would not pray to be reborn.”	The Buddha: “He doesn’t speak of purity in connection with     view, learning, knowledge, habit or practice. Nor is it found by a person through lack of view, of learning, of knowledge, of habit or practice.4 Letting these go, without grasping, at peace, independent, one wouldn’t long for becoming.”	“Not by view, nor by learning, nor by knowledge, (Māgandiya,” said the Blessed One), “nor do I speak of purity through good behavior and observances; but neither without view, without learning, without knowledge, without good behavior, without observances — not in that way. But having relinquished these, not grasping any of them, peaceful, not dependent, one should not hanker for existence.”	Neither from views, not from learning or knowledge, not from rites, or from vows, does purity come I say; nor from no views, no learning, no knowledge acquired, no rites and no vows—none of them at all, Neither by grasping nor giving them up is their peace unsupported, and no hunger “to be”.	Neither by what is seen, or heard, or known’, Nor by rites and rituals can purity be attained; Neither by the absence of what is seen, or heard, or ' known, Nor by non-observance of rituals can self-purity be gained. Leaving far such thoughts, by giving no shelter to them, Life one may not applaud, but guard, instead, the actions of tongue		839	MN 22 (in particular, the simile of the raft),

If so, I think this teaching is sheer confusion; for some believe in purity in terms of view.”	Māgandiya: “Well, if he doesn’t speak of purity in connection with     view, learning, knowledge, habit or practice. and it isn’t found by a person through lack of view, of learning, of knowledge, of habit or practice,5 it seems to me that this teaching’s simply confused, for some assume a purity in terms of —by means of6— a view.”	“If indeed it is not by view, by learning, nor by knowledge,” (said Māgandiya), “nor by good behavior and observances, that one speaks of purity; [165] nor without view, without learning, without knowledge, without good behavior and observances — not in that way, I think this is an utterly confused teaching; some fall back on purity by means of view.”	If you speak then not of purity by views, not by learning, not by knowledge, not rites and not vows; nor from no views, no learning, no knowledge acquired, by no rites and no vows—none of them at all,266 sutta nipāta then I think that this is very deluded Dharma, for some depend on views as the source of purity.	If by giving up five corruptions like what is heard or seen, Or by wisdom, rites and rituals, no purity may one expect, Nor, by non-entertaining heresies in the world, nor by ignorance, Nor by the absence of rites and rituals, can that designation [of purity] one attain, This, I deem, is falling into [the deep pit of] darkness: ‘That who—so-ever wants Purity can have it through heresies [alone		840

From this you’ve not glimpsed the slightest idea, which is why you consider the teaching confused	The Buddha: “Asking questions dependent on view, you’re confused by the things you have grasped. And so you don’t glimpse even the slightest notion [of what I am saying]. That’s why you think it’s confused.	“Asking repeatedly while dependent on a view, (Māgandiya,” said the Blessed One),   “you have become baffled over things tightly grasped. But from this you have not gained even an inkling; hence you consider it utterly confused.	Questioning repeatedly dependent on views, grasped at again, you’ve arrived at delusion, not having experienced even a tiny perception of peace, so therefore you see this as very deluded.	Ask, as you do, about Truth in what‘is heard or The Truth, mentally conceived, you take as to the Path; [The Truth] you may have approached, but hardly have discerned‘. How then with your words can you play false to the Saint?		841		
9.8	MĀGANDIYA	To Magandiya	samo visesī uda vā nihīno yo maññatī so vivadetha tena tīsu vidhāsu avikampamāno samo visesīti na tassa hoti	“Equal, superior or inferior”—if in these terms one thinks of oneself one might quarrel on that account. But if one is unshaken in the three modes, “equal-superior” ideas do not occur to him.	If you think that ‘I’m equal, special, or worse’, you’ll get into arguments. Unwavering in the face of the three discriminations, you’ll have no thought ‘I’m equal or special’.	Whoever supposes ‘equal,’ ‘superior,’ or ‘inferior,’ by that he’d dispute; whereas to one unaffected by these three, ‘equal,’ ‘superior,’ do not occur.	“One who thinks himself equal, superior, or inferior might engage in disputes because of this. Not shaking among these three discriminations, he does not think ‘equal, superior.’	Who as “equal” considers, “greater” or “less”, conceiving others thus would dispute because of this; but who by these three never is swayed, “equal”, “superior” does not exist.	Equal, or superior, or not even one’s equal’ To such notions, when attached, the discrimination doth one make; But in the absence of these three, what dispute can there be? All such [notions] he has cut ofi, and will it not therefore, in vain, be?		842		
9.9	MĀGANDIYA	To Magandiya	saccanti so brāhmaṇo kiṃ vadeyya musāti vā so vivadetha kena yasmiṃ samaṃ visamaṃ vāpi natthi sa kena vādaṃ paṭisaṃyujeyya	Why should the Brāhmaṇa say “this is true”? “This is false”: with whom should he so quarrel? The one who has no ideas of equality or inequality, with whom in the world should he join in quarrel?	Why would that brahmin say, ‘It’s true’, or with whom would they argue, ‘It’s false’? There is no equal or unequal in them, so who would they take on in debate?	Of what would the brahman say ‘true’ or ‘false,’ with whom would he dispute? With whom would he join in dispute, he in whom ‘equal,’ ‘unequal’ are not?	“Why would that brahmin assert, ‘It’s true,’ or with whom would he dispute, ‘It’s false’? When for him there is no ‘equal’ and ‘unequal,’ with whom would he engage in debate?	Why would this Brahmin declare “this is the true”, with whom would he argue that “this is false”, in whom there is not “equal”, “unequal”, with whom would he join another in dispute?	Here is the Truthful!’——-how can one thus proclaim? ‘To the void he has clung!’—such dispute who can raise? ‘Right or wrong’?all such [judgment] he has ended. In what words, then, can you his shortcomings declaim?		843

MĀGANDIYA	To Magandiya	okaṃ pahāya aniketasārī gāme akubbaṃ muni santhavāni kāmehi ritto apurakkharāno kathaṃ na viggayha janena kayirā	Leaving the house, roaming homeless, he should not make close connections with the village. Rid of sensual objects, not preoccupied with them, he should not talk in a quarrelsome way with people	After leaving shelter to migrate unsettled, a sage doesn’t get close to anyone in town. Rid of sensual pleasures, expecting nothing, they wouldn’t get in arguments with people.	Having abandoned home, living free from society, the sage in villages creates no intimacies. Remote from sensuality, not preferring, he wouldn’t engage with people in quarrelsome debate.	“Having left home to roam without abode, in the village the muni is intimate with none. Void of sensual pleasures, without preferences, he would not engage in contentious talk with people.	With home let go, faring on in homelessness, in villages the Sage having no intimates, rid of sensual desires, having no preference, would not with any arguments people engage	The ocean of craving he gives up, and into the unthinkable he doth pass; Into the country, with dexterity, endurance doth he practise; From craving released, no undue regard  [for any] doth he cherish, All the worldly poisons he has vanquished, and will not [again] be born		844	A long explanation of this verse, attributed to Ven.

Like the water-born thorny-stalked lotus is unsoiled by water and mud, so the Muni who speaks of peace and is not greedy is unsoiled by sensual pleasures.	A spiritual giant would not take up for argument  the things in the world from which they live secluded. As a prickly lotus born in the water is unsullied by water and mud, so the greedless sage, proponent of peace, is unsmeared by sensuality and the world.	Those things aloof from which he should go about in the world: The Nāga wouldn’t take them up &argue for them. As the prickly lotus is unsmeared by water &mud, so the sage, an exponent of peace, without greed, is unsmeared by sensuality & the world.	“When he wanders detached from things in the world, the nāga would not grasp and assert them. [166] As a thorny-stalked lotus, born in the water,198 is untainted by water and mud, just so the muni, a proponent of peace, free of greed, is untainted by sensual pleasures and the world.	Unattached, one wanders forth in the world, a Nāga, ungrasping, would not dispute those, just as the water lily, thorny-stemmed species, sullied is not by water or mud, even so is the ungreedy Sage proclaiming Peace, unsullied by desires and pleasures in the world	All the world over, he wandered, seeking suffering to destroy, From all dispute was the Saint free, not joining issues with any; Like the water-lotus, that i pure and devoid ofmud, And unsullied by particles, thick, of filth and mire; Quiescent is the Sage, who from lust is all free, With no attachmentsfor the world or its pleasures that may be		845

He is not traceable through action or learning he is not led to take up an abode anywhere	A knowledge master does not become conceited due to view or thought, for they do not identify with that. They’ve no need for deeds or learning they’re not indoctrinated in dogmas	An attainer-of-knowledge isn’t measured made proud8 by views or what’s thought, for he isn’t fashioned9 of them. He wouldn’t be led by action,10 learning; doesn’t reach a conclusion in any entrenchments.	“Because of a view199 or an opinion a Veda-master does not become conceited, for he does not identify with them. Not led by kamma or by what is heard, he is not drawn to any abodes.	The Wise One’s not conceited by view or by intelligence, for that one there is no “making-it-mine”; and cannot be led by good works or by learning, cannot be led away by mind-shelters of view	No conceived notions he permits to roll in his mind, He moves like the Released. ‘and from consciousness all freed; In none of the three’ actions merged, doth he move about, And _the three Realms of life he gives up, which he, commends to none		846

But those who have taken up notions and views— they go around the world clashing with each other	There are no ties for one detached from ideas; there are no delusions for one freed by wisdom. But those who have adopted ideas and views wander the world causing conflict.”	For one dispassionate toward perception there are no snares; for one released by discernment, no delusions. Those who grasp at perceptions &views go about clashing in the world.”	“For one detached from perception there are no knots; for one liberated by wisdom there are no delusions. But those who have grasped perceptions and views wander in the world creating friction.”	For one detached from perception, there exist no ties, for one by wisdom freed, no delusions are there, but those who have grasped perceptions and views, they wander the world stirring up strife	With no perceptions-—which he has relinquished — fetters he has none. Delivered as he is by wisdom, no delusions doth he harbour; Heresies and perceptions he has curbed, and to the rest he never clings, With all clamour being disgusted, over the three realms he walks about 		847

His greed gone, not miserly, the sage doesn’t speak of himself as among those who are higher, equal, or lower. He, theory-free, goes to no theory.	“Devoid of greed, without miserliness, the muni does not speak [of himself] as among superiors, or equals, or inferiors. Not given to mental construction, he does not enter upon mental constructs.	gone greediness and never mean, not speaking of themselves as “high” not “equal”, nor “inferior” so the unfittable does not fit,	No jealousy has he nor any greed doth he harbour; Although to a high position is exhalted, he doth not rejoice in it, Nor does he rejoice as a middling or low; The precepts of the Law he doth follow and its violation he doth give up		860		Muni

Conjoined with avarice are quarrels and dispute, and among those engaged in dispute there are slanders.	“Quarrels and disputes come from what we hold dear, as do lamentation and sorrow, stinginess, conceit and arrogance. Quarrels and disputes are linked to stinginess, and when disputes have arisen there is slander.”	“From what is dear there have arisen quarrels, disputes, lamentation, sorrows, along with stinginess, conceit &pride, along with divisiveness. Tied up with stinginess are quarrels &disputes.

Quarrels and disputes are connected with miserliness, and slanders occur when disputes arise.”	Much love of arguments, disputes, means sorrow, lamentation, selfishness, with arrogance, pride and slander too. Inclined to selfishness, arguments, disputes; quarrels, slander also come to birth.
